          <p>Bishop Allison Theological College, the theological college of the Diocese of Yei of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan, began in 1945 as Yei Divinity School. Sudan was moving towards independence, and the time had clearly come for the development of national leadership for the Episcopal Church. Therefore, the church founded Yei Divinity School in 1945, and Rev. Fred Crabb served as its first principal. Yei Divinity School combined the desire of Paul Gibson, the first Church Mission Society (CMS) missionary in Yei, for relevant village ministry with the vision of Rt. Rev. Morris Gelsthorpe, the first Bishop of the Sudan, for a trained and professional clergy. Yei, however, was not centrally located with respect to the various CMS mission stations, especially those in Bahr el Ghazal. So in 1947 the school was moved to a more central location. The British District Commissioner in Amadi granted a plot of land for the college at Mori, on a strip of land between the Mori and Yei rivers, and the college was renamed Bishop Gwynne College after the pioneer CMS missionary who had served in the Sudan.</p>

          <p>In the same spirit of church leadership development, Rt. Rev. Seme Luate Solomona, the first Diocesan Bishop of Yei, established Bishop Allison Bible School (BABS) in 1993 during the war of liberation in the Sudan. The name for the Bible school came from the former Bishop of the Sudan, Rt. Rev. Oliver Allison. Bishop Seme began BABS in the rural area of Mongo near Yei town, but the school relocated to Koboko, Uganda because of the intensified military insurgency in the Yei area. In October 1996, while the school was in Koboko, the West Nile Bank Front, a Ugandan rebel group, burned the school down. The school then moved to Arua, Uganda, eventually establishing itself in Pajulu Sub-County.</p>

          <p>During the institution’s time in Arua, the Province of the Episcopal Church of Sudan decided to elevate Bishop Allison Bible School from the diocesan level to the provincial level and to rename the school Bishop Allison Theological College (BATC). At its beginning BATC was the first theological institution in the Episcopal Church of Sudan to offer a diploma in theology course, which it offered through its affiliation with St. Paul’s Theological College in Limuru, Kenya (now St. Paul’s University). Because it was the only theological college offering theological studies at the diploma level, Christian men and women from all over southern Sudan came to BATC to receive their theological training.</p>

          <p>After the independence of South Sudan, the college relocated back to Yei. BATC operated in Yei from 2015 until 2016, but in July 2016, war again affected the Yei area. The college was once again forced to return to Uganda. Since then, BATC has continued in Arua, Uganda, educating pastors and other church and community leaders.</p>

          <p>Graduates of Bishop Allison Theological College have served in various roles in their churches and communities. Graduates have served in the church as lay leaders, pastors, bishops, and archbishops. Additionally, students from BATC have served in political positions, such as speaker of state parliament. We celebrate the ways in which God has used Bishop Allison Theological College in the past to train leaders for the churches and communities of South Sudan, and we pray that God will continue to use the college to prepare future leaders for South Sudan.</p>
